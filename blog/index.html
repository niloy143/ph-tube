				<div>
					<div class="py-3">
						<h3 class="font-semibold">var</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc ml-5">
							<li>If a variable is declared using var, it would be scoped in the function where it's declared.</li>
							<li>
								It can be accessed from anywhere inside that function, even before it's declaration, in that case the value of the variable would be
								undefined.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</div>
					<div class="py-3">
						<h3 class="font-semibold">let</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc ml-5">
							<li>
								Variables declared using let would be scoped in the block where they are declared. A block can be indicated by curly braces (e.g.
								loops, if-else, switch-case, try-catch etc.)

				<div>
					<div class="py-3">
						<h3 class="font-semibold">null</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc ml-5">
							<li>Null indicates the absence of a value in the variable.</li>
							<li>It can be used to indicate that there should be a value that is currently missing.</li>
							<li>A variable can be assigned null value if there is no value currently to store, but in future it would come.</li>
							<li>If a variable loses a value, it can be assigned the null value to indicate that the value is currently unavailable.</li>

						<h3 class="font-semibold">undefined</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc ml-5">
							<li>When a variable isn't given any value yet, in JavaScript, it's given undefined by default.</li>
							<li>Undefined is the default value of any variable that's not assigned any value.</li>
							<li>Unlike null, undefined means the variable is blank, while null means the variable is currently absent.</li>

				<h2 class="text-xl pb-3">Question 3: What do you mean by <b>REST API</b>?</h2>
				<div>
					<p class="pb-2">
						API is the middleman between the client and the server, while REST API is like a set of operations or a system of the API's that arranges
						operations. In other words, REST API is a representation of the API which specifies the operations such as GET, POST, PUT etc.
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc ml-5">
						<li><b>REST</b> stands for <b>Representational</b> <b>State</b> <b>Transfer</b>.</li>
						<li><b>API</b> stands for <b>Application</b><b>Programming</b><b>Interface</b>.</li>
						<li>REST API is used to arrange/specify the operations between the client and server.</li>
						<li>
							When a client makes a certain request to the server, if it uses REST API methods, then the server can easily understand which type of
							operation the client is trying to make.
						</li>
						<li>
							<p>There are various kinds of operations in the <b>REST</b> method such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc.</p>
							<ul class="list-[square] ml-5">
								<li>GET request means the client wants to read something from the server.</li>
								<li>POST means the client wants to create/write something.</li>
								<li>PUT means the client wants to update some existing values.</li>
								<li>DELETE means the client wants to delete certain things.</li>
